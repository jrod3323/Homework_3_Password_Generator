## Usage

This project is a random password generator.  It takes in a user input of desired password length to determine how long the password will be.  It will also request the type of characters the user would like to have in their password.  The password character types are Lower Case, Upper Case, Numeric, and Special Character.  The application will also verify data entered by the user.  It will first verify their password length is numeric.  The second verification is to verify that they have selected atleast one character type.  Finally, the application will generate a random password based upon the length requested by the user and it will pull random characters from the list of characters that the user requested.  

An addiitonal button has been added to copy the randomly generated password to the users clipboard for ease of use.
